# power-meter esp32-micropython

## Software for an ESP32 based power meter with a small OLED display and Wifi. IoT!!!

(in development)

A 0.96" OLED diplay allows showing the data. This allows both tracking instantaneous usage as well as how much more energy has been produced than used (or not!).
The flash storage built into the ESP32 allows recording around (TBD) days of data at a resolution of (TBD) minutes. Furthermore, the ESP32 serves a small web app so the data can be loaded and visualized in the web browser of a smartphone or PC.
